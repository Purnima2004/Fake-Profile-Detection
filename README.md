# Project:
Title: Detecting Fake Social Media Profiles Using SVM
Description:
Our project focused on leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVM) to identify fraudulent social media profiles. We collected a diverse dataset, extracted relevant features, and trained the SVM model to distinguish between genuine and fake accounts. The system, integrated into a user-friendly interface, demonstrated promising results in real-time profile authenticity assessments. This approach contributes to enhancing online security and user trust by effectively combating the issue of fake social media profiles.
