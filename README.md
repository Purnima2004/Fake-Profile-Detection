# Project description:
This project aims to detect fake profiles on social media platforms using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Through the analysis of user data and behavioral patterns, the model makes predictions about the authenticity of a profile. The dataset contains characteristics that act as features for the ANN, such as the number of friends, followers, status updates, language, and profile settings.

The approach includes feature engineering, data preprocessing, dividing data into test, validation, and training sets, and creating an artificial neural network (ANN) for binary classification. The ANN model is trained using labeled data to achieve an accuracy of 99% in classifying fake and real profiles.
