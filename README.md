# Project description:
Support Vector Machines (SVM) has been employed in this project to automatically detect and flag fake social media profiles. Through the examination of several data sets, such as activity patterns and profile details, the system extracts relevant features to differentiate between real and fraudulent profiles. Enhancing online security, lowering the danger of fraudulent activity, and promoting a more trustworthy social media community are the objectives. Accuracy, user-friendly integration, and ongoing progress based on user feedback are the main goals of the project.
